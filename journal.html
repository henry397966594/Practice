        I saw some burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Passing Cars,When you cant't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars.

        My first day of the trip！I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.Because I'm not on a Segway, I wasn't
        able to bring a whole lot with me:cell phone ,ipod,digital camera,and a protein bar.just the essentials.AS Lao TZU
        would have said，”A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
